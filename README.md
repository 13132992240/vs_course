### todo list

	- exchange sort by CKJ p374-376
	- choose sort by PHY p380-382
	- merge sort, radix sorting by TN p386-389


### some suggestions for beginners
	- Get a blank paper, and a pen, write down the logical structure.
	- Prepare examples for each data structure, details examples please see header files. start at main function.
	- Try more exercise and be skilled on those data structure.
